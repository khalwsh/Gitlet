# Gitlet
## Overview
A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

- Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.

- Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.

- Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.

- Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.

- Merging changes made in one branch into another.

In Gitlet, you donâ€™t just commit individual files at a time. Instead, you can commit a coherent set of files at the same time. We like to think of each commit as a snapshot of your entire project at one point in time.

In Gilet we support branching and have different history of commits derived from the same commit , also we support merging them in one new commit.
